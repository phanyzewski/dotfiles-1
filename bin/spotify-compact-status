# `spotify status` (from https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify) returns the
# following:
#
#  Spotify is currently playing.
#  Artist: Lewis Capaldi
#  Album: Bruises
#  Track: Bruises
#  Position: 2:07 / 3:38
#
# That's way too long for a tmux status line (and take 0.75-1 seconds), so this
# script uses osascript directly to return the following string in about 0.3
# seconds:
#
# Bruises by Lewis Capaldi
