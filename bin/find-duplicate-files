# Print out every file matching a pattern, turn it into its basename so we can
# run `uniq -c` and count it no matter where it is, use rg/sed to remove cruft
# from `uniq -c`, then pass the basename back into `mdfind` to print out where
# the duplicate files actually are.
# The pattern can be like '*.txt' (in quotes so it doesn't expand in the shell).
# Only searches (recursively) in the current directory.
