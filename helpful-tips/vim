How do I autocomplete the current line (not word)?
C-x-l will autocomplete as much of the current line as possible. Say you have a line
  like: "Given I sign up", then you can type "Given", press C-x-l, and it'll
  autocomplete to "Given I sign up" (if that's the only Given line), or if
  other lines match, they'll show up in a standard autocomplete menu. This is
  really helpful in cucumber feature files. (Thanks, Harold)


= cucumber.vim
If you're on a step line (Given/When/Then) in a cucumber feature file (*.feature), pressing C-] will
  go to the file where that step is defined. Pressing C-6 will go back to the
  feature file. (Thanks, Harold)
