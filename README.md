# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: `~/.*`

## Tools I use

* ZSH. To change your default shell to ZSH: `chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER`
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).
* [iTerm2](http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/downloads/list)
* Vim 7.3+. Homebrew recipe available [here](https://gist.github.com/2331951):
  `brew install URL`
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/)

## Nice to have

These don't relate to my dotfiles at all, but I keep forgetting to install them
on new machines.

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/install)

## Linking the dotfiles into ~

To interactively link the dotfiles into `~`, run:

    ./install.sh
