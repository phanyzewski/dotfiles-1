# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: `~/.*`

## Prerequisites

* ZSH. To change your default shell to ZSH: `chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER`
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

## Installation

To interactively link the dotfiles into `~`, run:

    $ ./install.sh
    $ brew bundle
    $ vim +BundleInstall +qa


## Nice to have

These don't relate to my dotfiles at all, but I keep forgetting to install them
on new machines.
