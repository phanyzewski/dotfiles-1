# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: `~/.*`

## Installation

To interactively link the dotfiles into `~`, run:

    ./install.sh

## Tools I use

* ZSH. To change your default shell to ZSH: `chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER`
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).
* Vim 7.3+. `brew install https://gist.github.com/2331951`
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/): `brew install rbenv`

## Nice to have

These don't relate to my dotfiles at all, but I keep forgetting to install them
on new machines.
