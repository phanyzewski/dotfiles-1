# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: `~/.*`

## Prerequisites

* ZSH. To change your default shell to ZSH: `chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER`
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Installation

    $ ./install.sh

## Nice to have

These don't relate to my dotfiles at all, but I keep forgetting to install them
on new machines.

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/install)
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) (from the Mac App Store)
