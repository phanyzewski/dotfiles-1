# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles: `~/.*`

## Prerequisites

* ZSH. To change your default shell to ZSH: `chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER`
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Installation

    $ ./install.sh

## Interesting Bits

My ZSH prompt is fairly well documented, and is self-contained: you can copy it
into your dotfiles with no changes to test it out. It's in
[zsh/prompt.zsh][prompt].

[prompt]: /zsh/prompt.zsh

## Nice to have

These don't relate to my dotfiles at all, but I keep forgetting to install them
on new machines.

* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/install)
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) (from the Mac App Store)

## Plugin-specific settings and mappings

directory](/vim/rcplugins).
